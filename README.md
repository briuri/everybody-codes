# Everybody Codes

This project contains my Everybody Codes solutions in Kotlin. 

The top-level of the project can be imported as an IntelliJ IDEA project. Solutions are found under 
`puzzles-<language>/src/` with a package naming convention of `buri.aoc.y<yy>.q<qq>`. Each Quest can be run from a JUnit 
test harness, colocated in the day's `Puzzle` class (this avoids the mental context-switching cost of using a `TestCase` file
under `/src/test/` when competing).
