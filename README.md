# Everybody Codes

This project contains my Everybody Codes solutions in Kotlin. 

The top-level of the project can be imported as an IntelliJ IDEA project. Solutions are found under 
`/src/` with a package naming convention of `buri.ec.e<yyyy>.q<qq>`. Each Quest can be run from a JUnit 
test harness, colocated in the day's `Puzzle` class (a practice carried over from my Advent of Code repository
which helps me avoid the mental context-switching cost of using a `TestCase` file under `/src/test/` while competing).

## License

While I am making this source code available for public viewing, I am not releasing it for reuse or modification at 
this time.

## Possible Optimizations

I may get around to optimizing these slow algorithms some day:
